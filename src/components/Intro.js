          <p>
            I am a full-stack software engineer skilled in JavaScript and
            Python. I build functional, tested software and I am always up for a
            challenge. I am curious, I like solving complex problems and
            learning new things, be it new skills or new activities. Programming
            gives me exactly that and it is very rewarding to see working
            software as a result of my effort. Having studied physics, I learned
            how to learn fast and comprehend complex ideas quickly, while
            working in business, I was able to apply these skills to a broader
            range of topics. Now, I am looking for a full-stack position where I
            can solve problems, contribute, learn and further grow as an
            engineer.
